      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vaibhav Makwana. I'm an ambitious GIS professional with a strong foundation in ArcGIS, Python, C#, Javascript and SQL. I also hold a basic drone flight certificate and ROC-A certificate which allows me to communicate over aviation frequency. I believe my strong side is problem solving whether its a programming problem or a hardware problem, solving problems is my favourite part of any job. On my free time I love to code and learn about new technologies, recently I built my own custom computer by researching various parts to optimise and build a perfect setup for my day to day tasks. This website is one of my side projects to learn web development, Thank you for visiting! and Please feel free to contact me through email or linkedin!",

My primary job as a GIS Analyst is to analyze data, create figures, and work on ArcGIS Modelbuilder to perform complex analysis on huge datasets. Using the ArcHydro set of tools, I have worked on multiple Watershed delineation projects, Floodplain mapping, and Hydrological modelling. I have learnt countless new techniques and tools to perform my job more efficiently.",
